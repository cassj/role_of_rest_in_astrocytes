This project pulls in a number of other projects using git's submodule support. 
For details on how to fully checkout a project with submodules, see https://git.wiki.kernel.org/index.php/GitSubmoduleTutorial

The submodules will need a Capfile.local file to override their default group and mount points. For example, for Johnson_ChIPPET:

 set :group_name, 'role_of_rest_in_astrocytes'
 set :availability_zone, 'eu-west-1a'  #must be the same as that of superproject 
 set :dev, '/dev/sdg'
 set :mount_point, '/mnt/johnson'

In the main project directory you should then be able to do:

 cap EC2:start
 cap EBS:create
 cap EBS:format_xfs #(if you're not creating from an existing snapshot)
 cap EBS:mount_xfs

and in each of the submodules

 cap EBS:create
 cap EBS:mount_xfs
